# Task 06: Explore the Time Entry agent

## Introduction
The Time Entry agent can be challenging to setup up and configure. You must fully deploy Project Operations and Dual-Write before you begin to set up the agent.


Due to the time constraints for this workshop and the complexity of setting up and configuring Project Operations and other prerequisites, we aren't including any hands-on activities related to the Time Entry agent. The steps are similar to the steps you performed to set up the other agents. Steps include:

- Create the organization's agent identity (user account).
- Activate the Power Automate flows that the agent requires. 
- Enable the feature flag.
- Publish the agent from Microsoft Copilot Studio to users in the organization.

The agent uses 13 different Power Automate flows. The flows must be activated in a specific order to avoid errors and issues.
