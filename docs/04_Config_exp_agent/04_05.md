# Task 05: Run the installation file

## Introduction
To configure the Expense agent, you must perform a large number of steps in a specific order. To simplify the process, instead of manually performing the steps, you'll run a Windows PowerShell script that automates all of the steps. 
The script performs the following activities on your behalf:

- Set environment variables
- Verify and link connection references
- Enable Power Automate flows
- Publish the required Copilot agents
- Publish the Dataverse solution

## Description

In this task, you'll configure and then run a PowerShell script to set up the Expense agent.

## Success criteria

The PowerShell deployment script completes successfully.
