# Task 01: Create identities (user accounts) for agents

## Introduction
For demonstration purposes you can run the agents under your admin account. However, customers and partners may decide to use separate identities for each agent. 

You only need to create the identities once on your environment. Then, you can use the identities across environments.

## Description

In this task, you'll create identities for each of the following agents:

- Account Reconciliation
- Expense
- Supplier Communications
- Time

## Success criteria

- You've created the required identities
- You've assigned the required licenses to each identity
